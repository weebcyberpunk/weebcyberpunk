# Hello

I'm Double G, but you can call me GG, also known as weebcyberpunk.

I like low level programming in C and high level programming in Python. Also,
I'm currently learning Rust.

My editors of choice are Vim and Neovim. You can check my configs
[here](https://github.com/weebcyberpunk/nyanvim). Here are some plugins I wrote
for them:  
- [run.vim](https://github.com/weebcyberpunk/run.vim)  
- [lf.vim](https://github.com/weebcyberpunk/lf.vim)  

I like to have beautiful and cute things, so ricing my desktop is another hobby.
You can check my configs and my wallpaper collection here:
